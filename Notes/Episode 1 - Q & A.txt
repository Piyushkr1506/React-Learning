## Difference between Library and Framewok?
 
- Libraried target a specific functionality, while a framework tries to provide
everything required to develop a complete application.

- Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps 
you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.

- A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer 
what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where 
and when they need it.

- The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer 
will dictate how “opinionated” it is.

## async and defer??

Asynchronous scripts don't wait for each other. So if a smaller script is second in the order, it will be loaded before the previous longer one. 
Deferred scripts maintain their relative order which means the first script will be loaded first while all others below it will have to wait.
